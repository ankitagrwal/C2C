# AI Test Case Generation Platform - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Enterprise Design System

**Selected Approach:** Design System (Enterprise-focused)
**Primary Reference:** Carbon Design System + Material Design Enterprise patterns
**Justification:** This is a complex enterprise B2B platform requiring data-heavy interfaces, professional credibility, and consistent patterns across multiple workflows.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Dark Mode Primary (Default):**
- Background: 220 15% 8% (deep navy-charcoal)
- Surface: 220 12% 12% (elevated cards)
- Primary Brand: 210 85% 55% (professional blue)
- Success: 142 70% 45% (test pass states)
- Warning: 38 85% 55% (pending/processing)
- Error: 0 75% 55% (test failures)
- Text Primary: 0 0% 95%
- Text Secondary: 0 0% 70%

**Light Mode:**
- Background: 0 0% 98%
- Surface: 0 0% 100%
- Same accent colors with adjusted lightness for contrast

### B. Typography
**Primary Font:** Inter (via Google Fonts CDN)
**Secondary Font:** JetBrains Mono (for code snippets, test IDs)

**Hierarchy:**
- H1: text-3xl font-semibold (Page titles, Dashboard headers)
- H2: text-xl font-medium (Section headers, Card titles)  
- Body: text-sm font-normal (Primary content, descriptions)
- Caption: text-xs font-medium (Status labels, metadata)

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Primitives:** Tailwind units of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12
- Micro spacing: p-2, gap-2 (8px) for tight elements
- Standard spacing: p-4, m-4 (16px) for general layouts
- Section spacing: p-6, mb-8 (24px, 32px) for card padding and vertical rhythm
- Page spacing: p-8, p-12 (32px, 48px) for major layout sections

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Sidebar navigation with collapsible sections
- Top navigation breadcrumbs for deep workflows
- Tab navigation for configuration sections

**Data Displays:**
- Cards with subtle borders and shadows for test case groups
- Tables with zebra striping for large datasets
- Progress indicators for document processing and test execution
- Status badges with consistent color coding
- Metrics cards with large numbers and trend indicators

**Forms:**
- Clean, bordered inputs with floating labels
- Multi-step wizards for complex configurations
- File upload areas with drag-and-drop styling
- Toggle switches for feature flags and settings

**Overlays:**
- Modal dialogs for configuration and detailed views
- Slide-out panels for document preview and test details
- Toast notifications for system feedback
- Contextual tooltips for complex features

**Charts & Visualization:**
- Clean, minimal chart styling using Chart.js or similar
- Consistent color mapping across all data visualizations
- Dashboard widgets with clear metric hierarchy

### E. Key UI Patterns

**Dashboard Layout:**
- Grid-based metric cards at top
- Tabbed content areas for different data views
- Sidebar filters and controls
- Real-time status indicators

**Document Management:**
- List view with preview thumbnails
- Batch selection capabilities
- Processing status indicators
- Integration badges showing source systems

**Test Case Interface:**
- Hierarchical tree view for test organization
- Inline editing capabilities
- Bulk operations toolbar
- Export and sharing controls

**Enterprise Features:**
- Professional header with company branding area
- User management interfaces with role indicators
- Audit trail displays with timestamp formatting
- Integration status panels with health indicators

### F. Responsive Behavior
- Desktop-first design (primary use case is workstations)
- Tablet: Collapsible sidebar, stacked metrics
- Mobile: Bottom navigation, simplified views for monitoring

### G. Interaction States
- Subtle hover states on interactive elements
- Loading skeletons for data-heavy operations
- Clear disabled states for restricted features
- Progressive disclosure for complex configurations

This design system prioritizes professional credibility, data clarity, and workflow efficiency over visual flair, aligning with enterprise user expectations while maintaining modern design standards.
