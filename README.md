## üß† AI Architecture & Test Case Generation

### AI Technology Stack

**Primary AI Engine:**
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** - Production AI model for all test case generation
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Real-time monitoring and logging
- Optimized for reliability and speed

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline:**
1. **Document Processing** - Extracts text from uploaded documents
2. **Intelligent Chunking** - Breaks documents into contextual segments
3. **Vector Embeddings** - Converts chunks to semantic vectors using OpenAI embeddings
4. **Context Retrieval** - Finds relevant document sections via similarity search
5. **AI Generation** - Gemini analyzes context and generates structured test cases

**Vector Database:**
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for embedding storage and similarity search
- Efficient nearest-neighbor search for context retrieval


### Test Case Generation Process

**Phase 1: Document Analysis**
- Extracts business rules, workflows, and requirements
- Identifies edge cases, compliance requirements, and integration points
- Analyzes potential failure scenarios and boundary conditions

**Phase 2: Rule Validation**
- Validates extracted rules against document context
- Ensures completeness and accuracy
- Cross-references business logic

**Phase 3: Test Case Generation**
- Generates exactly 15 comprehensive test cases per document
- **Category Distribution:**
  - Functional Tests: ~6 cases (40%) - Core business logic validation
  - Edge Case Tests: ~5 cases (30%) - Boundary conditions and error scenarios
  - Compliance Tests: ~3 cases (20%) - Regulatory and security requirements
  - Integration Tests: ~1 case (10%) - System interaction validation
- **Priority Assignment**: High/Medium/Low based on business criticality
- **Severity Assignment**: High/Medium/Low based on operational impact
- **Persona Assignment**: Hourly Employee, HR Admin, Salaried Employee, System Admin, etc.
- **Detailed Steps**: Each test case includes 5-10 specific, executable steps

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "title": "Descriptive test case name",
  "category": "functional|edge_case|compliance|integration",
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "severity": "High|Medium|Low",
  "persona": "HR Admin|System Admin|etc",
  "description": "Clear test objective",
  "steps": "Step 1: Action\nStep 2: Verification\n...",
  "expectedResults": "Specific, measurable outcomes",
  "tags": ["domain", "system", "risk-level"]
}
```
