# AI Test Case Generation Platform - Revised Plan for Replit

## Project Overview
Enterprise AI-powered test case generation platform with RAG integration for 2-day MVP development.

---

## Core Features Required

### ✅ **Authentication & Access**
- Admin authentication system with role-based access control
- Secure login/register functionality

### ✅ **Internal Tools Configuration**  
- Internal tools configuration dashboard with mock integrations
- **3 Mock Tools**: Salesforce CRM, SAP Enterprise, Internal HR Portal
- Connection status indicators and configuration forms
- Dummy API integration (no real connections needed)

### ✅ **Customer Management**
- Customer management with solution_id import from configured tools
- Solution_id as unique identifier across all internal tools
- Customer configuration status (configured/not configured boolean)
- Import customers from selected internal tools using mock data

### ✅ **Document Processing**
- Document upload and ingestion system
- **Supported Formats**: .pdf, .doc/.docx, .txt only
- Document validation and parsing
- Customer association (only configured customers can upload)

### ✅ **RAG Implementation**
- RAG-enhanced AI test case generation using OpenAI GPT-4 and embeddings
- Document chunking and vector search implementation with pgvector
- Supabase vector extension integration
- Context-aware test case generation

### ✅ **AI Processing**
- **Two-phase AI processing**: Analysis → Rule Validation → Generation
- Real-time progress indicators for each phase
- OpenAI integration with pre-configured API key (no model selection UI)

### ✅ **Test Case Management**
- Test case categorization: **Functional Tests, Compliance Tests, Edge Cases, Integration Tests**
- Test case management dashboard with review and editing capabilities
- Display RAG context used for each generated test case
- File upload option for additional test cases (.csv/.json format)
- Category filtering and search functionality

### ✅ **Dashboard & Reporting**
- Professional enterprise UI with comprehensive data visualization and charts
- Review dashboard with quick stats and test case previews
- Execution tracking with test status management and basic reporting
- Mark tests as "Ready", "In Progress", "Complete"

## ❌ **Excluded for MVP (Phase 2)**
- Export functionality (ZIP files) - **Skip for now**
- Email delivery options - **Skip for now**  
- Advanced model configuration - **Single OpenAI model only**
- Real internal tool API integrations - **Mock data only**

---

## Technical Stack Specifications

### **Database (Supabase)**
```sql
-- Required tables with pgvector extension
- internal_tools (mock integrations)
- customers (with solution_id and is_configured)
- documents (pdf/doc/txt support)
- document_chunks (RAG embeddings)
- test_cases (with RAG context and categories)
```

### **Frontend (React + Replit)**
- React with Tailwind CSS
- File upload with drag-drop interface
- Real-time progress indicators
- Dashboard with charts (recharts)
- Professional enterprise UI design

### **AI Integration**
- OpenAI GPT-4 for test case generation
- OpenAI Embeddings API for RAG
- Vector similarity search
- Context injection for better test cases

## Mock Data Requirements

### **3 Internal Tools**
1. **Salesforce CRM** (OAuth mock)
2. **SAP Enterprise** (API key mock)  
3. **Internal HR Portal** (Basic auth mock)

### **Sample Customers with solution_id**
- `SF_001_TECH` - TechCorp Inc (Technology)
- `SF_002_FIN` - FinanceGroup LLC (Financial)
- `SAP_HC_001` - HealthCare Partners (Healthcare)
- `HR_EDU_001` - Education Institute (Education)

### **Document Templates**
- Software License Agreements
- Employee Handbooks
- HIPAA Compliance Manuals
- Union Agreements

## User Workflow
1. **Admin Login** → 
2. **Configure Internal Tools** (mock integrations) →
3. **Import/Configure Customers** (with solution_id) →
4. **Upload Documents** (pdf/doc/txt) →
5. **AI Processing** (RAG + GPT-4 generation) →
6. **Review Test Cases** (with RAG context) →
7. **Track Execution** (status management)

## Key Success Criteria
- End-to-end workflow completion
- RAG context visible in generated test cases
- Professional enterprise UI with **Clause2Case** branding
- Real-time processing indicators
- 15+ test cases per document across 4 categories
- Demo-ready with realistic mock data

## Timeline: 2 Days MVP
**Focus on core AI/RAG functionality over export features**

**Clause2Case** - Transform business documents into comprehensive test cases with AI-powered intelligence. This revised plan prioritizes the most impactful features for a successful POC demonstration while maintaining realistic 2-day development scope.
