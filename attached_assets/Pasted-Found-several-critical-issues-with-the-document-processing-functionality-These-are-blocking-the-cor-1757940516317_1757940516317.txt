Found several critical issues with the document processing functionality. These are blocking the core workflow:
üö® Critical Document Issues
1. Browse Files Button - Not Working

Issue: "Browse Files" button is completely non-functional
Expected: Opens file picker dialog for .pdf/.docx/.txt selection
Impact: Users can only try drag-drop, no alternative method

2. File Upload Failing - 503 Service Unavailable

Issue: Getting "Upload failed: 503 - Service Unavailable" error
Expected: Successful file upload with progress indicator
Impact: No files can be uploaded at all - complete blocker

3. Document Parsing Not Working

Issue: System cannot extract basic information from uploaded files
Expected: Auto-extract from document (especially first page):

Company name (e.g., "TechCorp Inc")
Company type (e.g., "Restaurant", "Technology", etc.)
Document type (Contract, Handbook, Agreement, etc.)


Current: No parsing happening - data extraction fails completely

üéØ Expected Smart Workflow
User should be able to:

Upload via Browse OR Drag-drop (both should work)
Auto-parse document and extract:

   ‚úÖ Company: [Extracted from doc]
   ‚úÖ Industry: [Extracted from doc] 
   ‚úÖ Doc Type: [Extracted from doc]

Smart customer matching:

If customer exists ‚Üí proceed to test generation
If customer doesn't exist ‚Üí show auto-creation prompt with extracted details



üîß Immediate Fixes Needed
Priority 1: Fix 503 error - nothing works without file upload
Priority 2: Fix Browse Files button - critical UX issue
Priority 3: Implement document parsing - core intelligence feature
üìÑ Test Case
I have a sample restaurant document where:

Company name is clearly visible on first page
Industry type "Restaurant" is mentioned on first page
Document type can be inferred from content

This should auto-extract and either match existing customer or prompt for customer creation.
‚è∞ Urgency
These issues are completely blocking the demo workflow. Without working file upload and parsing, we can't demonstrate any of the AI capabilities.
Can you prioritize the 503 error fix first, then the parsing logic?
Let me know if you need the sample document or more details about expected parsing behavior.
